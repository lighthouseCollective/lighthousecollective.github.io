### Structure of the Site
The site is going to be focused on the individuals that make up the collective - their profiles, links to portfolios, rates, and some details on what they can do. There will be some standard across all of these, but we want to capture the creativity and individualism of all the personalitis in the collective.

The focus here will not be to land gigs as much as it will be to tap into solid team members with current tasks in mind. Ideally, the platform will flourish into a sort of "digital subcontractor hub," where any of us can jump on and get an hour or two (or more) from someone in the collective that has domain-specific knowledge of the task at hand.
