[NEFFLI Website](http://www.newenglandffl.com)

[NEFFLI Repository](https://github.com/lighthouseCollective/neffliWebsite)

    Based in Maine, NEFFLI was looking for a new way to generate leads and establish legitamcy in their geosphere. 
    As the company expands, the html can be easily updated to add service areas, as well as employee bios. The
    success of SEO efforts will be monitored using a UID provided by Google Analytics. Lead generation will also 
    be monitored. 

    One strategy of SEO that we utilized here was a direct purchase of 7 domains other than the primary domain, to 
    increase traffic and web presence. The 7 reroute domains will only have one task - *to refresh as the primary url*.
